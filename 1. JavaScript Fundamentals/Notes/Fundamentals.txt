JavaScript
    - JavaScript is a High Level, object oriented, multi-paradigm, programming language.
    - High Level : We don't have to worry about complex stuff like memory management.
    - Object oriented : Based on objects for storing most kings of data.
    - Multi paradigm : We can use different styles of programming.

Things that can be done with JS 
    - Dynamic effects and web applications in the browser.
    - Its possible to use js outside browser i.e servers etc. with help of node.js.

JavaScript Versions
    - Before 2015 (ES6) :  Vanilla JavaScript.
    - 2015 Onwards : Advanced JavaScript.

Data Types
    - In JavaScript every value is either object or a primitive value
    - Primitive Types :
        1. Number : Floaring point numbers, used for decimals and integers.
        2. String : Sequence of characters, used for text
        3. Boolean : Logical type that can only be true or false, used for taking decisions.
        4. Undefined : Value taken by a variable that is not yet defined. (empty value).
        5. Null : Also means empty value.
        6. Symbol(ES2015) : Value that is unique and cannot be changed.
        7. BigInt(ES2020) : Larger integers that the Number type can hold.
    
    NOTE : JavaScript has dyanmic typing : we do not have to manually define the data type of the value stored
           in a variable. Instead, data types are determined automatically.
           (Alwayssss value has a type not variable)

Variable Declaration:
    1. let
        - we declare variables with let keyword that can be changed later.
        - It is block scoped variable.
    
    2. var
        - this is old way of declaring variable (vanilla js).
        - function scoped.
    
    3. const
        - block scoped.
        - cannot mutate variable.

Type Conversion and Type Coercion
    
    NaN - Whenever operation that involves number fails to produce new number. (Invalid Number)
    typeof NaN - number

    Conversion of number to string - String(123) -> "123"
    Conversion of string to number - Number("123") -> 123
                                     Number("a1") -> NaN
    
    Type Conversion : When we do Conversion manually.

    Type Coercion : JavaScript does it automatically for us.
        - Whenever there include more than one data type in operation it does coercion.
